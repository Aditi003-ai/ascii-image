# Ascii-image
ASCII Image Generator using Python :
-Project Overview
The ASCII Image Generator is a Python-based image processing project that transforms a standard digital image into ASCII art.
ASCII art represents images using characters such as @, %, $, *, +, =, :, and . arranged in a grid-like structure. Darker areas of the image are represented by denser characters, while lighter areas use simpler characters.

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of:
Image processing
Pixel manipulation
Grayscale conversion
Character mapping
File handling in Python

The program generates:
A text-based ASCII file
An image-based ASCII rendering

## Objective:
The main goal of this project is to:

Understand how images are represented as pixels
Convert RGB images into grayscale
Map numerical pixel intensity values to characters
Produce artistic and readable ASCII outputs
This project is ideal for beginners learning Python, students exploring image processing, and creative coding enthusiasts.
